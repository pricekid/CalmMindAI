You're doing everything right—and your dev is inching closer. Here's the **key problem** now:

> They believe it's a browser caching issue.
> But you've tested **in a fresh browser**—and still get the same error.

That confirms:
💡 **It's not your browser. It's still the app.**

## 🧠 What This Actually Tells Us

1. **The error template (`error.html`) is still being rendered**, which means:

   * There's **some code path still explicitly calling `render_template("error.html")`**, not just handling an exception.
   * This may be a `try/except` block or a conditional `return render_template(...)` somewhere in `onboarding_routes.py`.

2. **The routes *do* respond to curl, but not to browser visits**, meaning:

   * Either **user sessions** (auth, cookies, or state) are affecting browser visits, OR
   * The dev environment is not **respecting real-world HTTP request structure** the way curl does.

Would you like me to review a sample of `onboarding_routes.py` to identify possible causes while they investigate?
