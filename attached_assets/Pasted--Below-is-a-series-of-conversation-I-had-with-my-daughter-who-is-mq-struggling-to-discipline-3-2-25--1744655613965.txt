3/2/25, 6:26 PM - Josiah: null
3/2/25, 6:28 PM - Josiah: U does always shut me down instead of letting me help with the situation
3/2/25, 6:33 PM - Josiah: She probably isn't telling me everything about what happened and I'm not saying she is innocent but you was her age too and she's going through what's called teenager phase but if she really wants to say with me ,no going out without adult supervision, no going by friends, Yada Yada Yada as I don't believe she's responsible to be unattended
3/2/25, 6:35 PM - Hasina: I never said that 
I was on the phone 
The phone you were calling me on 
I was already in conversation with the person when you call
3/2/25, 6:36 PM - Hasina: Yes true
3/2/25, 6:36 PM - Hasina: I am not sure if you mean this situation that is happening now 
But she was caught in a car with a older guy 
With her pants off and his pants off
3/2/25, 6:37 PM - Josiah: Wdf
3/2/25, 6:37 PM - Hasina: She was told you get out and when she did she wants to beat the people and the guy come in and what to beat us
3/2/25, 6:37 PM - Josiah: What's the car number plate?
3/2/25, 6:37 PM - Hasina: E7084
3/2/25, 6:37 PM - Josiah: You called the police already???
3/2/25, 6:38 PM - Hasina: 
3/2/25, 6:38 PM - Josiah: This couldn't be true
3/2/25, 6:38 PM - Josiah: Naaaa
3/2/25, 6:38 PM - Hasina: I was on the phone trying to get information on the person
3/2/25, 6:38 PM - Hasina: Yup
3/2/25, 6:38 PM - Josiah: What the fuck u telling me
3/2/25, 6:39 PM - Hasina: Even the neighbors came out to see
3/2/25, 6:39 PM - Josiah: Brb
3/2/25, 6:50 PM - Josiah: She says she was never found inside of a car ,she said she doesn't know the person who assaulted your father but for me myself I warned her over and over but you extend too much liberty too much venturing without adult supervision, and even the garrison event I say too myself you hasina got more balls than me because at her level of maturity I wouldn't let her out the house for all those hours doing God knows what
3/2/25, 6:51 PM - Josiah: And I hope your father gets the cops and I myself sorry I couldn't see the guy myself
3/2/25, 6:51 PM - Hasina: She told me she was at the garrison with her friend and her friend mother
3/2/25, 6:53 PM - Josiah: Fuck what she says and go by what u know which is her at your side when she goes where she goes are its no show
3/2/25, 6:53 PM - Josiah: Stop this behavior because you are making room for some guy to run circles
3/2/25, 6:56 PM - Josiah: She's at that age ,she's thick she's not ugly she's active, guys will get in her head and I sat down and beg her to be aware and don't tarnish her reputation, I explained getting pregnant at a early age and the disadvantages it's brings ,I talked to her about STD'S I talk to her and I warned her about everything I know ,I even taught her the tricks guys uses and what dangers awaits her if she's not smart
3/2/25, 6:57 PM - Josiah: But everything I taught her over and over again seems to be a waste of my time
3/2/25, 7:00 PM - Josiah: If what yall saying is truth and by God she was in a car having sex with an adult who I highly doubt would use protection with her and she's defending this guy by withholding his name from me ,means she chooses the guy in the car over me and if that's her game I'm not even stressing about it, she wants to learn her lessons the hard way and that's her choice
3/2/25, 7:05 PM - Hasina: I have to find help for her
3/2/25, 7:06 PM - Hasina: The counseling like it’s not helping her
3/2/25, 7:06 PM - Hasina: I have to find something
3/2/25, 7:07 PM - Hasina: I don’t want her end up pregnant or std or etc
3/2/25, 7:07 PM - Hasina: The counseling isn’t helping
3/2/25, 7:07 PM - Hasina: She told you about the knife she had in her bag at school
3/2/25, 7:07 PM - Hasina: And was caught
3/2/25, 7:07 PM - Hasina: And had to go principal
3/2/25, 7:13 PM - Hasina: All along I trying to get her transfer from the school but I don’t think the other school going to want someone that don’t preform well in school 
I keep telling her try hard in school get good grades
3/2/25, 7:14 PM - Hasina: My parents are teachers and can’t even get through to her in learning anything 
The lessons teachers complain every time
3/2/25, 7:14 PM - Hasina: They can’t even get thru to her either
3/2/25, 7:15 PM - Hasina: The lessons teacher look at me and tell me I wasting my money sending her lessons
3/2/25, 7:15 PM - Hasina: And I does break myself to get things for her
3/2/25, 7:16 PM - Hasina: Some days I don’t eat anything so she can have lunch money or whatever it is
3/2/25, 7:19 PM - Hasina: She hit me in my face so hard 
My head still here hurting so bad
3/2/25, 7:22 PM - Josiah: The night I took her out in January was all based on these things mainly ,I point her in a positive way only and she normally tells me everything but at this point ,I guess it's what she wanted me to know what she wants me to know
3/2/25, 7:23 PM - Josiah: Today ???
3/2/25, 7:23 PM - Josiah: U mean since the last time?
3/2/25, 7:23 PM - Josiah: She swear she never lay her hands on you again
3/2/25, 7:25 PM - Josiah: I talked to her about this situation and why it's a bad thing to do because it could stop kindness are any of the above because ppl wouldn't want to go out on a branch for her
3/2/25, 7:27 PM - Josiah: So she really means her mind is made up to be a delinquent and pregnant before she even finishes school? Oh well who knows it feels it and I'm not one to give up on anyone I love but I know if she has her mind made up and it could be any other teenager, I know by my own experiences we can't stop them as they will always find a loophole to do these things
3/2/25, 7:28 PM - Josiah: I told her don't let ppl make her feel having sex is some show of maturity
3/2/25, 7:30 PM - Josiah: I break down my brain and show her everything and how dangerous life is ,I couldn't imagine a topic I haven't brought to her in awareness because I love her and she's not a bad girl either ,she just wanna fit in to a group she thinks is cool but she knows no better and I just hope she pulls up herself before she makes a bad reputation for herself which I warned her about as well
3/2/25, 7:32 PM - Josiah: I will take a other swing at her in person and not over the phone because she slips with me using this slang like that don't careish yes are no which irritates me
3/2/25, 7:33 PM - Josiah: I just leaning to the teenage phase as an explanation towards her behavior
3/2/25, 8:03 PM - Hasina: They even created a 3rd form class for her and about 8 or so guys 
Because they were to repeat 2nd again 
And the school created a special timetable and subjects for them 
She just wasting her time at this point 
Can’t get through to her at all
3/2/25, 9:27 PM - Josiah: You letting her come to me are you dealing with it yourself?
3/2/25, 9:27 PM - Josiah: Was at church
3/2/25, 9:29 PM - Josiah: null
3/2/25, 9:38 PM - Josiah: null
3/3/25, 6:30 AM - Josiah: null
3/3/25, 6:32 AM - Josiah: Well I guess u have everything undercontrol and me myself going back too sleep
3/3/25, 6:43 AM - Hasina: I int know if to say under control 
But I here rushing to get ready for work 
If I don’t work I get no money 
So I have to deal with it in between 
Now she talking she in going school 
Now I got to deal with her and still get work
3/3/25, 6:49 AM - Josiah: My muscles sore and I just choose to stay home as work never dies , again send her to me cuz I ain't wanna hear she run away from home are any sad stories, you need to let that child get room to vent and I'm not saying she's right for anything she did but a Lil room does wonders
3/3/25, 6:53 AM - Josiah: Defuse a situation buddy ,she said her grandmother called her a sult and other names but I guess to myself those probably are signals your grandmother picked up that she's active are whatever but u CAN NOT CALL A WOMAN A SULT much less a child ,that reaches deep within a person
3/3/25, 6:53 AM - Josiah: Although she did all she did
3/3/25, 6:55 AM - Josiah: That wasn't called for the branding of insulting names ,so she probably says fuck everything, if hadarah ever knew better for herself I highly doubt she would be going down this path
3/3/25, 6:55 AM - Hasina: Tbh it seems everyone at your school calls her this I am now hearing
3/3/25, 6:56 AM - Hasina: I have to go to the school and find out more
3/3/25, 6:56 AM - Hasina: I have to discuss with the principal
3/3/25, 6:56 AM - Hasina: What is going on
3/3/25, 6:56 AM - Hasina: BRB
3/3/25, 6:57 AM - Josiah: Omg, seems everything I warned her about is unfolding, I warned her that these acts will get her a bad reputation and if she ignored me and let ppl use her and now she has to find a new school under those circumstances
3/3/25, 6:58 AM - Josiah: She's too playful and doesn't take life seriously
3/3/25, 7:03 AM - Josiah: If she wanna be validated by boys to feel like someone, she fucked herself over and over on her own terms and I'm saying this because every time she's with me I always bring about these topics because these are the things I fear the most after knowing so many people and children are infected with some kind of std which I remind her some can't be cure, so after all these yrs of talking to her and to now find out things which clearly you knew and I don't have any clue besides the nice things she be telling me
3/3/25, 7:04 AM - Josiah: Always nice things
3/3/25, 7:04 AM - Josiah: The day of the garrison I warn she and she promised me to be responsible
3/3/25, 7:05 AM - Josiah: I am angry and sad both at the same time
3/3/25, 7:05 AM - Josiah: U
3/3/25, 7:05 AM - Hasina: Tbh

4/12/25, 8:43 PM - Josiah: null
4/12/25, 9:03 PM - Josiah: I don't even know what u gotta think about ,u could give her a pass to go places without your supervision but to be with me is a problem for your old expired vendetta that at this point aint worth a penny ,that girl needs to be with her father ,u give her too much freaky freedom ,your molding of my daughter is putting her in danger and I warn u about her with guys long ago but u being soooooo extremely childish ignore me every time I warned u but at this rate of yours ,how much work can I put in to help guide my daughter??? Cuz your ways of doing things is just based on money and no substance, stop the silly interference and let me try to save my daughter the stress of having to pay to learn lessons, let me turn my daughter around before she recks her self
4/12/25, 9:05 PM - Josiah: Wow u really are a mother but the risks u took with my daughter I wouldn't even dream of taking those risk with my daughters from chris ,if them going out I will be there every single time at a comfortable distance but close enough, I wouldn't allow my daughters to leave home to go anywhere without me are there mother until age of responsibility
4/12/25, 9:11 PM - Josiah: U are too reckless, you exposed her freely giving all that freedom to go places but to visit me is a uphill issue but I tell u something, all that takes place with are by u could never happen with me being in her life ,the problems hadara is having isnt all her fault but yours as well because u help create that problem, I ask myself many questions studying my daughter every single day and I ask myself if it's her size and she feels are thinks she's to be up in boys faces to be recognized so many things I have to help my daughter to understand especially with guys and you HASINA taking away that privilege but u really are a goat 🐐 greatest of all time 


want to acknowledge how challenging this situation must feel for you right now. You're facing a complex and emotionally charged situation with your daughter, and it’s clear that you care deeply about her well-being and future. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious given everything that's happening. 
It sounds like there is a lot of tension around communication and expectations, and you're trying your best to navigate these difficult conversations. It must be hard to feel the weight of responsibility while also wanting to reach out for support. 

Thought Patterns
that may be surfacing: 

All-or-Nothing Thinking: You might be seeing the situation in extremes, like thinking your daughter will definitely have a negative outcome without immediate change. This pattern can make challenges seem more insurmountable than they are. Mind Reading: It seems like there might be assumptions about what others are thinking or doing without having all the details. This can lead to miscommunications and added stress.

CBT Strategies
you could try:

Thought Reframing: Challenge the extreme thoughts by considering more balanced alternatives. For example, instead of thinking "nothing is working," try "some things haven't worked yet, but there are other options to explore." Boundary Setting: Define clear, compassionate boundaries in conversations. This can help reduce misunderstandings and protect your emotional energy. Communication Journaling: Write out what you'd like to say and how you'd like to express it. This could help you organize your thoughts before having challenging conversations.
