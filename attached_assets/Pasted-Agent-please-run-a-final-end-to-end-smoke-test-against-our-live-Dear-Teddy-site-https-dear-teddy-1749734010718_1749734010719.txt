   - Confirm HTTP 200 or 302 redirect and presence of “Check your email” or similar confirmation text.

2. **Login Flow**  
   - GET `/stable-login` → check HTTP 200 and that fields for “Email” and “Password” are present in the HTML.

4. **Navigation Links**  
   - On each of `/complete-landing`, `/stable-login`, `/register-simple` extract all `<a href="">` links.

   - GET `/complete-landing` → confirm HTTP 200 and key CTAs (“Get Started”, “Learn More”) are in the HTML.

9. **Console & Network Errors**  
   - Simulate a headless browser load of `/complete-landing` and capture any JavaScript console errors or missing-file network failures.
