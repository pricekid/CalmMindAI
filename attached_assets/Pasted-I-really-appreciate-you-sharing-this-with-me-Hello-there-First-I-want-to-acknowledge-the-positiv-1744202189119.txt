I really appreciate you sharing this with me. Hello there,

First, I want to acknowledge the positive side of your journal entry: your willingness to help a colleague. This shows you are a considerate and supportive person, which are truly admirable qualities. It's important to celebrate those moments of kindness, as they contribute to a positive work environment.

Now, let's gently explore the thoughts and feelings you're experiencing. It seems like you're caught in a cycle of feeling overwhelmed because you often say "yes" to requests, even when it conflicts with your own needs. This pattern might be tied to a few cognitive distortions, such as:

1. **People-pleasing tendencies**: The fear of being perceived as selfish or unreliable might be pushing you to say "yes" too often. This can lead to neglecting your own needs and feeling overwhelmed.

2. **All-or-nothing thinking**: You may be viewing your decision to help as either being completely selfless or entirely selfish, without considering a middle ground where you can help others while still respecting your own boundaries.

Here are a few CBT techniques you might find helpful:

1. **Re-evaluate your beliefs**: Ask yourself, "What would I tell a friend in this situation?" Often we are kinder to others than to ourselves. This can help you see that setting boundaries isn't selfish—it's necessary for your well-being.

2. **Practice saying "no"**: Start small by saying "no" to a minor request. This will build your confidence in setting boundaries. Remember, saying no to one thing means saying yes to something else, like your well-being or priorities.

3. **Challenge all-or-nothing thinking**: Try to identify situations where you've successfully balanced helping others with your own needs. Reflecting on these scenarios can help you find that middle ground more easily.

Finally, here's a little prompt to help you reflect on a personal strength: Think about a time when you successfully advocated for yourself. What qualities did you draw upon to make that happen, and how can you harness them again?

Sending you warmth and encouragement as you navigate this journey. You're taking important steps toward finding balance in your life.

Take care,
[Your Name]
 CBT Analysis
Based on your journal entry, here are some thought patterns and CBT techniques that might help:

Mind Reading
Assuming others will view you as selfish or unreliable if you don't help them. - Challenge this thought by asking yourself for evidence. Write down past instances where you set boundaries and observe if others truly saw you negatively or respected your limits.

All-or-Nothing Thinking
Believing that you must either help others completely or not at all, with no middle ground. - Practice finding a middle ground by considering compromise solutions. Next time, propose helping in a limited capacity that doesn’t overwhelm your schedule.

Personalization
Blaming yourself for feeling overwhelmed without considering external factors like workload or unrealistic expectations. - Use a thought record to differentiate between factors within and beyond your control. This helps in reducing self-blame and focusing on actionable solutions.
