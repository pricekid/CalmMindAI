I want to acknowledge how challenging this situation must feel for you right now. You're facing a complex and emotionally charged situation with your daughter, and it’s clear that you care deeply about her well-being and future. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious given everything that's happening. 
It sounds like there is a lot of tension around communication and expectations, and you're trying your best to navigate these difficult conversations. It must be hard to feel the weight of responsibility while also wanting to reach out for support. 

Thought Patterns
that may be surfacing: 

All-or-Nothing Thinking: You might be seeing the situation in extremes, like thinking your daughter will definitely have a negative outcome without immediate change. This pattern can make challenges seem more insurmountable than they are. Mind Reading: It seems like there might be assumptions about what others are thinking or doing without having all the details. This can lead to miscommunications and added stress.

CBT Strategies
you could try:

Thought Reframing: Challenge the extreme thoughts by considering more balanced alternatives. For example, instead of thinking "nothing is working," try "some things haven't worked yet, but there are other options to explore." Boundary Setting: Define clear, compassionate boundaries in conversations. This can help reduce misunderstandings and protect your emotional energy. Communication Journaling: Write out what you'd like to say and how you'd like to express it. This could help you organize your thoughts before having challenging conversations.
