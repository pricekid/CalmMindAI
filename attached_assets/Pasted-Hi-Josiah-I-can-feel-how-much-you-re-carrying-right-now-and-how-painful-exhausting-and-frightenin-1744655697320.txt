Hi Josiah, I can feel how much you're carrying right now—and how painful, exhausting, and frightening it must be to love your daughter so deeply while also feeling so powerless and overwhelmed. You're doing so much: working, parenting, managing co-parenting conflict, and trying to help your daughter through a very serious and risky phase. You’re not failing—you’re in crisis, and your concern shows just how deeply you care.
Thought Patterns That May Be Surfacing:
* Personalization: You may be feeling like her choices reflect your worth or effectiveness as a mother (“What am I doing wrong?”). This is a very human thought, but it's not fully true—you are not the cause of all her behavior.
* Catastrophizing: Understandably, you’re imagining worst-case outcomes (pregnancy, STDs, future failure). This can amplify your anxiety and make problem-solving harder.
* Emotional Reasoning: Feeling hopeless or exhausted may lead to thoughts like “nothing is working,” even though you’re actively trying many things.
CBT-Based Strategies:
1. Separate the Problem from the Person Your daughter is in distress and making dangerous choices, but she is not beyond help. Try to hold both truths: you love her and you must protect your peace.
2. Boundary Reframing Define what is yours to carry (structure, safety, emotional limits) and what must be hers (school effort, honesty, behavior). Repeating this may help reduce your burnout.
3. Self-Compassion Prompt Write this sentence: “Even though I feel ________, I am showing up by __________.” Example: “Even though I feel defeated, I am showing up by finding help.” 
4. Grounding Action Today Choose one thing today to reduce the emotional chaos. Maybe that’s contacting the school, journaling without censoring, or planning a break for yourself.

Reflection Prompt “What part of this crisis is mine to carry—and what can I start letting go of, even if just a little?”
You're not alone. You're not a bad mother. You're exhausted because you care deeply—and care is never wasted.
Warmly, Coach Mira
