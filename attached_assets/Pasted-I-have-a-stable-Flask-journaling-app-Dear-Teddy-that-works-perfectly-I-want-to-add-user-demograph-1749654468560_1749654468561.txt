I have a stable Flask journaling app (Dear Teddy) that works perfectly. I want to add user demographics collection WITHOUT breaking the existing functionality.
Critical Requirements
1. NO NEW BLUEPRINTS - Add all functionality directly to the main app.py file
2. NO SEPARATE ROUTE FILES - Keep all routes in one place
3. MODIFY EXISTING TEMPLATES - Don't create duplicate templates
4. PRESERVE ALL EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY - Login, register, journal, dashboard must continue working exactly as before
What I Want to Add
Add a simple demographics collection step that happens ONCE after a user first registers:
Demographics to Collect:
* Age range (dropdown: 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 65+)
* Gender (dropdown: Male, Female, Non-binary, Prefer not to say)
* Location (text input for city/state)
* Primary mental health concerns (checkboxes: Anxiety, Depression, Stress, Sleep issues, Relationship issues, Work stress, Other)
Implementation Requirements:
1. Add demographics fields to the existing User model
2. Add a demographics_collected boolean field to track completion
3. After successful registration, redirect to a demographics form instead of dashboard
4. Once demographics are submitted, redirect to dashboard
5. For existing users, show the demographics form on their next login if not completed
6. Store demographics in the database and use them to personalize AI responses
Implementation Instructions:
* Modify the existing app_stable.py file ONLY
* Add the new fields to the User model
* Add ONE new route /demographics to handle the form
* Modify the register and login routes to check demographics status
* Create ONE new template demographics.html
* Update database migration to add new columns
What NOT to do:
* Don't create any blueprint files
* Don't create separate route files
* Don't duplicate existing functionality
* Don't modify the core login/register/journal functionality
* Don't add multiple TTS services or admin systems
* Don't import external route modules
Keep it simple and contained within the single app file structure.
