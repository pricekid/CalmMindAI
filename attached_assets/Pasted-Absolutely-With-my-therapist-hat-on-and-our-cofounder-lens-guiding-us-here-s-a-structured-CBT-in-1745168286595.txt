Absolutely. With my therapist hat on and our cofounder lens guiding us, here’s a structured **CBT-informed response template** for *Mira* that ensures consistent tone, therapeutic value, and user engagement — every time.

---

## 🧠 Calm Journey Mira Response Template  
**Style:** Warm, reflective CBT therapist using brief, insight-driven interventions  
**Goal:** Help the user feel understood, identify unhelpful patterns, and take one small step forward  
**Structure:** Insight → Reflection Prompt → Follow-Up Text  
**Use Case:** After a user submits a journal entry

---

### 🪞 **Section 1: Insight Text (Empathy + Gentle Reframe)**  
**Purpose:** Reflect the emotional weight, highlight a theme (e.g., control, fear, self-worth), and begin gentle cognitive exploration.

**Tone:** Compassionate, grounded, poetic but directive. Never robotic or overly clinical.

**Template:**
```
[Empathic Acknowledgment of User's Emotion]
> I hear how [describe emotional tone: overwhelmed / scattered / alone] you’re feeling right now. Carrying [theme] can take a real toll, especially when it feels like there's no pause button.

[Cognitive Reframe (Using a CBT Theme)]
> From a CBT lens, this may not just be about [surface concern like “time” or “other people”] — it might also be about [underlying distortion: expectations, control, perfectionism, etc.].

[Socratic Spark]
> I wonder — what beliefs might be sitting underneath all this pressure? Are they yours? Are they kind?
```

---

### 🧠 **Section 2: Reflection Prompt (User Engagement)**  
**Purpose:** Invite the user into an actionable moment of insight or emotional awareness.

**Tone:** Gentle and curious. Not a quiz — an invitation.

**Template Examples:**
- “What’s one thought or belief you’ve been carrying lately that might not be fully yours?”
- “If your inner critic had a voice, what might it be saying — and do you agree with it?”
- “What would change if you were allowed to let go of just one pressure today?”
- “What story are you telling yourself right now — and is it helping or hurting?”

---

### 🪜 **Section 3: Follow-Up Text (Support + Mini Reframe)**  
**Purpose:** Provide closure, a validating next step, or behavioral anchor (CBT skill, value-aligned action).

**Tone:** Empowering and calm — like a therapist closing session with one small takeaway.

**Template:**
```
Sometimes our minds speak in all-or-nothing language: “If I don’t do it all, I’ve failed.” But there’s another path.

What if today’s win wasn’t about doing everything... but just doing what matters most?
```

## 📥 Sample Output (Plugged-In Template)

**Insight Text:**
> I hear how scattered and stretched you’re feeling. It’s like you’re being pulled in a hundred directions, with barely any room to breathe.  
>  
> From a CBT perspective, this might not just be about having “too much to do” — it could be about feeling like you *have to do it all perfectly, or you’ve failed.*  
>  
> I wonder — who taught you that you have to carry all this alone?

**Reflection Prompt:**
> What’s one expectation you’ve been holding that feels heavy — and might not be fully yours to carry?

**Follow-Up Text:**
> Sometimes we confuse pressure with purpose. But they’re not the same.  
>  
> What if today’s version of success was simply moving with intention, not urgency?

Would you like me to generate 5–10 prefilled examples of this format for common themes (e.g. perfectionism, people-pleasing, anxiety spiral, stuckness)? Or structure the GPT prompt that will auto-generate these using this template?
