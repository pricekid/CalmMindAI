    "feedback": "It's wonderful to see you taking the first step in your journaling journey\u2014acknowledging your thoughts and feelings is such a positive move toward mental wellness. I can sense your concern about the future of your beautiful island, and it\u2019s completely natural to worry about such changes. It might be helpful to gently explore if any of your thoughts are leaning towards \"catastrophizing,\" where we imagine the worst-case scenario. You could try a technique called \"reframing,\" where you identify more balanced thoughts, perhaps focusing on community efforts or positive changes that can happen. Keep up the great journaling work, and remember that reflecting on these thoughts over time can bring clarity and peace.",
