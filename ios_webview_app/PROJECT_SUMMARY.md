# Calm Journey iOS WebView App Project

## Overview

This project provides the files needed to create an iOS WebView wrapper app for the Calm Journey web application. The WebView app allows users to access the web-based Calm Journey application through a native iOS app interface.

## Key Features

1. **Native iOS App Experience**: Provides a native app wrapper around the web application
2. **Enhanced User Interface**: Native navigation, pull-to-refresh, and progress indicators
3. **Offline Error Handling**: Improved error states when offline
4. **Privacy-Focused Analytics**: Built-in user activity tracking with privacy controls
5. **Structured Implementation**: Complete code and documentation for easy integration

## Implementation Steps

To create the iOS app from these files:

1. Create a new Xcode project
2. Copy the provided files into the appropriate locations in your project
3. Update the app URL in WebViewController.swift to your deployed web application
4. Configure app icons and branding
5. Build and test the application

For detailed instructions, see the [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) file.

## Analytics and Privacy

The app includes a privacy-focused analytics system that:

- Tracks user interactions anonymously
- Stores data only on the device by default
- Provides transparency with user controls
- Follows best practices for data minimization

For full details on the tracking capabilities, see the [TRACKING_CAPABILITIES.md](./TRACKING_CAPABILITIES.md) file.

## Next Steps

1. Set up an Apple Developer account if you don't have one
2. Create the Xcode project and integrate these files
3. Test thoroughly on multiple iOS devices and versions
4. Prepare App Store submission materials (screenshots, description, etc.)
5. Submit to the App Store for review
