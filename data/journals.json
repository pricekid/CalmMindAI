This can bring up mixed feelings\u2014perhaps a bit of confusion or even a sense of uncertainty about where you stand. I wonder how this makes you feel about your role within the team. Take a moment to consider how these interactions align with your expectations of teamwork. Remember, you bring valuable perspectives and skills to the table. Trust in your ability to navigate these dynamics with grace.\n\nWarmly,\nCoach Mira",
