It's really wonderful to see you making progress on the Dear Teddy app. Even though your journal entry carries a neutral tone, there's a sense of accomplishment underlying your words. Developing something new can sometimes feel like a neutral task, but there's often a quiet pride in seeing how far you've come. Take a moment to reflect on what this progress means to you personally\u2014what emotions arise when you think about bringing this app to life? Remember, acknowledging even our neutral feelings can lead to deeper insights. Keep celebrating your wins, big or small. You're doing great!\n\nWarmly,\nCoach Mira\n\nWe're starting to notice a few thought patterns in your journals. Here's what we're seeing:\n- Journal Reflection\n",
