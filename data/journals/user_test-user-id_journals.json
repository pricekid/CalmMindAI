It's wonderful that you're able to recognize both the challenges of your day and your ability to manage through them. This balance in your perspective is a great foundation for growth. You might explore how reframing challenges as opportunities for learning can shift your perspective even further. To support this, try using a CBT technique like the \"Three Column Technique,\" where you identify a challenging thought, explore the evidence for and against it, and then consider a more balanced thought. Keep reflecting and journaling; each entry is a valuable step on your journey to greater self-awareness and mental well-being.",
