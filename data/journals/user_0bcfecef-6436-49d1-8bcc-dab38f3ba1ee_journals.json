    "feedback": "It's wonderful that you've taken the first step in your mental wellness journey by starting this journaling practice. It sounds like you're juggling quite a bit, and it's understandable to feel tired when things aren't going as planned. This might be a good opportunity to explore perfectionist thinking patterns, where we set very high standards for ourselves and feel disappointed when things don\u2019t meet them. Consider using the \"thought record\" technique to identify and reframe these thoughts, or try setting smaller, achievable goals to build a sense of accomplishment. Keep up the great work with your journaling\u2014each entry is a step toward greater self-awareness and growth.",
