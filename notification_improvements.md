# Notification System Improvements

## Issues Fixed
- Fixed missing email configuration variables
- Added default values for mail server (smtp.gmail.com) and sender
- Resolved environment variable access problems
- Created consolidated notification tracking system
- Implemented proper error handling for email sending

## New Features
- Enhanced notification tracking system
  - Tracks different notification types (email, SMS, weekly summary)
  - Provides unified tracking interface
  - Prevents duplicate notifications
  - Cleans up old tracking data automatically
  - Provides notification statistics

- Improved scheduler service
  - Uses updated notification tracking system
  - Properly handles email configuration
  - Maintains persistent notification history

- Testing utilities
  - Added test scripts for notification system
  - Added test scripts for email configuration
  - Improved scheduler restart capability

## How It Works
1. The notification system uses environment variables for SMTP configuration
2. Default values are provided for common settings (smtp.gmail.com, port 587)
3. The tracking system stores notification history by type and date
4. The scheduler checks if a user has already received notifications before sending new ones
5. All notification activity is logged for troubleshooting

## Next Steps
- Add weekly summary notifications with statistics about journal entries
- Implement SMS notification improvements
- Add notification preferences to user settings page

## Usage
```python
# To track a sent notification
from notification_tracking import track_notification
track_notification('email', user_id)

# To check if a user has received a notification today
from notification_tracking import has_received_notification
if not has_received_notification('email', user_id):
    # Send notification
```

The notification system now provides a robust foundation for user engagement and retention through timely, personalized reminders and communications.
