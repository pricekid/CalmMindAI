## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
Ensure all required environment variables are configured in your deployment platform.

### 2. Database Migration
The application automatically creates tables on startup. No manual migration required.

### 3. Health Verification
After deployment, verify these endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Application health
- `GET /ready` - Deployment readiness
- `GET /metrics` - Performance metrics

### 4. Security Verification
Confirm security headers are present in HTTP responses and authentication flows work correctly.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Response times (target: <100ms for 95th percentile)
- Error rates (target: <1% for 4xx/5xx errors)
- Database connection health
- Memory usage (alert if >80%)

### Log Monitoring
- Authentication events
- Performance warnings (>1s response time)
- Security alerts (blocked IPs, injection attempts)
- Application errors and exceptions
