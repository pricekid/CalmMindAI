# Manual Render Deployment Guide

## Files Created for Deployment

I've created a streamlined `main.py` that fixes the authentication issues caused by the session secret change. This replaces your complex `app.py` with a production-ready version.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Your Render Service
1. Go to your Render dashboard at render.com
2. Find your Dear Teddy service
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment
4. Verify these environment variables exist:
   - `DATABASE_URL` 
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (your updated value)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`

### 2. Deploy the Fix
Option A - Manual Deploy:
1. In your Render dashboard, click "Manual Deploy"
2. This will pull the new `main.py` file from your repository

Option B - Git Push:
1. Commit the new files to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add main.py
   git commit -m "Fix authentication after session secret change"
   git push
   ```
2. Render will auto-deploy if connected to your repository

### 3. What the Fix Does
- Handles corrupted sessions gracefully instead of crashing
- Clears invalid session data before login attempts
- Provides proper error recovery for authentication flows
- Maintains compatibility with existing user database

### 4. Expected Results After Deployment
- Registration should work without crashes
- Login after registration should succeed
- Existing users can login with proper credentials
- No more "unexpected error" messages

### 5. Testing
After deployment, test in incognito mode:
1. Visit www.dearteddy.app/register
2. Create a new account
3. Verify automatic login to dashboard works
4. Log out and log back in manually

The session secret change caused authentication flow conflicts, but this fix ensures the app handles session errors gracefully instead of returning 500 errors.
